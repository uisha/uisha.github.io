This is my Portfolio Website. I'm still learning about web development and still studying mostly Python.

The Thesis Project I have planned is to create a TTS book app with the power of AI. You can think of it as an AI Audible where the AI will scan and read through the books and use appropriate voices for the lines in the book without needing to insert audio cues. My plan is to use BarkAI and host the computation on a cloud and then it will then download the audio file to the device's local app.
